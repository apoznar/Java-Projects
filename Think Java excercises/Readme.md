Here I store classes and methods written in Java.
All of them are excersizes' solutions from 'Think Java: How to think like a computer scientist' book, 
written by Allen B. Downey (2016).
About 90% of the code is written by myself, some small parts of code is updated by me from original book code and 
about 2-3% is copied from somewhere else because of lack of better answers.
